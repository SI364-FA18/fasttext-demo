# fastText Web Demo
Web demo of Facebook's fastText language detection.

TRY IT: Since I use Heroku free dyno, the first time you get the result might take several seconds because the server needed to wake up from sleep. Now, check it out: [yrsamrith.github.io/fasttext-demo](https://yrsamrith.github.io/fasttext-demo/)
